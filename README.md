# Daily Coding Challenges

Daily coding challenges to keep me sharp.
After completing three Advent of Code challenges, I thought I might wanna keep myself and my coding skills focused and sharp.

That's why I've signed up for the Daily Byte, which sends you one coding challenge daily. These challenges are not as difficult
as the ones in the AoC, but they are sweet, and give you a sense of accomplishment once you complete them.

I didn't want this repo to be heavy and cumbersome. You can use the Quokka extension for VS Code to run individual files, and I keep the original
wording of the challenge for clarity.

These challenges were taken in TypeScript, so I can also brush up on these, but they can be solved in any other programming language out there.

Happy coding!
