Daily coding challenges to keep me sharp.
After completing three [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, I thought I might wanna keep myself and my coding skills focused and sharp.

That's why I've signed up for [The Daily Byte](https://thedailybyte.dev/), which sends you one coding challenge daily. These challenges are not as difficult as the ones in the AoC, but they are sweet, and give you a sense of accomplishment once you complete them.

I also solved many [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems here, so you might see some familiar questions.

I didn't want this repo to be heavy and cumbersome. You can use the [Quokka](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode) extension for VS Code to run individual files, and I keep the original wording of the challenge for clarity.

These challenges were taken in TypeScript, so I can also brush up on these, but they can be solved in any other programming language out there.

Happy coding!
